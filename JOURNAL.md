## 10/26/2025 - Created a custom propeller  

The idea for this project came from the many versions of the Pullcopter that can be found find online. However, I couldn't really find any good ones that were using the "pulling" mechanism combined with a gear reduction system to maximize the propeller speed. So I decided to make my own.
Today, I started by designing a custom propeller. I took inspiration from a few online projects and here is the current result in SolidWorks:

It took quite a lot of effort, as SolidWorks sometimes just refuses to work unless you select the same thigs in a magically specific order (which took me a lot of time to figure out). However, I am currently pretty happy with it. I tried to give it a lot of thought and hopefully thanks to features like variable wing thickness (to improve lift), it will either fly really well or not at all, I'll have to see... Now, I'll start working on the gear reduction system and on the body so that I can test the propeller and improve it later based on its properties in flight.

Also, the bottom of the propeller, which attaches to the rotary shaft and should let go once the shaft stops putting in additional energy looks like this:
