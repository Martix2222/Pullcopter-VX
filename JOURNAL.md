## 10/26/2025 - Created a custom propeller  

The idea for this project came from the many versions of the Pullcopter that can be found find online. However, I couldn't really find any good ones that were using the "pulling" mechanism combined with a gear reduction system to maximize the propeller speed. So I decided to make my own.
Today, I started by designing a custom propeller. I took inspiration from a few online projects and here is the current result in SolidWorks:

It took quite a lot of effort, as SolidWorks sometimes just refuses to work unless you select the same thigs in a magically specific order (which took me a lot of time to figure out). However, I am currently pretty happy with it. I tried to give it a lot of thought and hopefully thanks to features like variable blade thickness (to improve lift), it will either fly really well or not at all, I'll have to see... Now, I'll start working on the gear reduction system and on the body so that I can test the propeller and improve it later based on its properties in flight.

Also, the bottom of the propeller, which attaches to the rotary shaft and should let go once the shaft stops putting in additional energy looks like this:

## 10/27/2025 - Fixed the propeller and started working on the gears  

So, firstly, I fixed some problems with the thickness of the propeller blades. (There were some places where its blades were too thick which I did not notice before)
I also made quite a lot of progress on the gear reduction mechanism. It currently looks like this:

It took me a lot of time to figure out how gears work in SolidWorks (fortunately a few tutorials helped) and how to make them into a proper assembly.

The last thing I worked on is the handle. I will now have to figure out how to incorporate all the mechanisms into it, such that it can then be printed and assembled easily:

(It currently really currently is just the handle part)
  

## 10/28/2025 - Everything broke  

Today, SolidWorks just decided to refuse to work and broke everything inside the gear assembly.

I tried fixing it but it just made things worse. So I decided to redo everything in a new assembly. The upside of this is that it allowed me to reconsider some things and I will include the handle in the assembly, so the whole body including the handle and the gearbox will be inside of one assembly now. I am also moving much faster now because I already know what to do and how to do it.

Furthermore, I printed and tested the propeller (It is compatible with another pullcopter I found online so that I could test it before I made my version of the body) and I decided to make the curvature of the blades less aggressive, because they were just too thick and it seemed to have worse properties overall.

## 10/29/2025 - Further improved the propeller  

I reduced the size of the propeller and reduced the mass of the blades by making them thinner. Now, I am pretty happy with it. It is also easier to print now.
